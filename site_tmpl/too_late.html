<h1>Too Late!</h1>
<p>
    It has been more than {{ days }} days since the end of {{ event.event_name }}, so the deadline for
    entering crew chief reports and crew hours has passed. In the future, we encourage you to submit a crew chief
    report shortly after an event while you still have all details of the event fresh in your mind. Delaying submitting
    your crew chief report directly delays the billing of this event because your report allows those responsible for
    billing the event to know what work was actually done and equipment was actually used, so that the event can be
    billed accordingly.
</p>
<p>
    Despite this, we still urge you to submit a crew chief report for this event! Please send it to a member of the
    executive board (or to lnl@wpi.edu), who will upload it to the database for you. These reports are invaluable
    to future LNL members, and we thank you in advance for filling one out and sending it to us!
