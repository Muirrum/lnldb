====================

Active members can now see a list of open leadership positions created by the
Executive Board.

Viewing Positions
-----------------
To view a list of open positions, go to the "Members" dropdown and find the
"Open Positions" link. Clicking that link will bring you to a list of positions
that are currently looking for interested members.

.. hint:
   You can click the name of a position to view more information

Applying
--------
Depending on how the Executive board has created the position, you can do one of
two things to express your interest. If they have created a form for interested
members, there will be a green "Apply" button that will take you to the form. If
they haven't created a form, look at the position description for more
information.
