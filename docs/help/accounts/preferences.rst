=====================================
Update Your Communication Preferences
=====================================

The LNLDB now allows you to have more control over what types of communications you receive from us. While you may not
be able to opt out of all communications, in many cases you will have the ability to customize how and when you receive
them.


Managing your preferences
-------------------------

If you haven't already, log into the LNLDB and click your name in the top right corner of the page. This will take you
to your user profile. Next, click on the large `Preferences` button to view your account preferences. Your communication
preferences will be listed under the `Communications` section.

When you are done updating your preferences, don't forget to hit `Save`!

    `Manage your preferences <https://lnl.wpi.edu/my/preferences/>`_

.. note::
    If you do not see the `Preferences` button on your profile page, then your current role does not support customizing
    your communication preferences. If this is the case and you are looking to opt out of LNL communications, please
    `contact us <mailto:lnl-w@wpi.edu>`_.
