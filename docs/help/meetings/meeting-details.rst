Create or Edit a Meeting
========================

The LNLDB can store details about nearly any type of LNL meeting (General Body, Exec, Committee, etc.) whether they
will occur in the future or have already happened. This is where LNL members can find meeting minutes, agendas,
attendance records, and related files.

.. caution::
    **Permission Required:** Modify Meeting Details

    In order to create new meetings or send meeting notices, you must have been assigned a role that allows you to
    modify meeting records. If you do not see the option to create a new meeting under `Meetings` in the navigation bar,
    your current roles do not grant you adequate permission.


**To create a new meeting or edit an existing one:**

#. In the navigation bar, select `Meetings` > `New Meeting`.
#. Select the meeting type from the dropdown.
#. Next, you’ll have the option to select the location where your meeting will take place. If the meeting will be
   virtual, select `Zoom – Virtual Meeting`.
#. In the `Datetime` field, be sure to select the date and time for when your meeting will begin. Dates must be in
   ``yyyy-mm-dd`` format and times should be in ``hh:mm a`` format.
#. For `Duration`, specify how long the meeting will last. This field accepts a quantifier followed by a unit of time,
   such as:

   a. ``30 seconds``
   b. ``an hour``
   c. ``3 days``

#. If you would like to add an agenda, update meeting minutes, or record attendance, begin by selecting the respective
   tab from the tab bar. For more details on how to update the attendance, see
   :ref:`Update Attendance <Update Attendance>`.
#. Finally, click `Save Changes`


**To delete a meeting:**

#. Follow the process above as if you were to edit the meeting.
#. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click `Delete`.
#. Finally, click `Yes!` to confirm the action.

Update Attendance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add someone to the meeting attendance list, simply type their name into the text box. As you type, the field will
automatically search our database for that user. If a user matching your query does not yet exist in our database, it
will search WPI’s LDAP system. Once you see the listing for the user you would like to add in the search results,
select the listing to add their name to the list.

To remove someone from the attendance list, click the trash can icon next to their name.
